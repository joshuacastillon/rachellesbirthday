                <h2>Dear Rachelle,</h2><br>
                <p>
                First, let me start this letter by wishing you a Happiest Birthday. Even though you have a duty for today which is not
                on timing hahaha, I still hope that you enjoy not only this day but also the days ahead. Spend time with your parents,
                because I know you are very excited to see them. Don’t forget to be grateful every day, because you have a very loving
                family who always there to support you in everything that you do. A very caring mother and father that is always there
                for you, always listen and check on you. Keep the bond with your friends and best friends by eating and laughing
                together. Rachelle, please keep being an amazing woman, very determined, cheerful, and kind, the person that I know from
                the beginning. Always think positive, you already faced very difficult challenges in life, yet you are still fighting
                and keeping on going, guess what? It’s because you are a very strong woman and I always know you can do it! You have
                your family, friends, and of course me who always and keep on believing in you. Rachelle, and when you feel like
                sometimes you can’t do it, it is okay to pause and rest and always remember your WHY, please do yourself a favor and do
                not be guilty when resting, you need it and you deserve it, you know that health is much important.
                Don’t forget that you already have me in your life, Rachelle. I’m one of the witness of all your efforts in what you do.
                I want you to know that I appreciate you so much, for being amazing, caring, honest, and just being you. Even we are far
                apart, I always be here to support and believe in you. I wish I’m also there to celebrate your birthday, but it is okay
                and I know it will happen, not now but it will happen.
                Lastly, don’t forget to thank God and talk to him not just whenever you are happy but also when you feel sad, confused
                or lost. I know he’s always there to listen and guide us. At very last, May God bless you and Happy Birthday baby, I
                miss you and I love you so much
                <br><br>
                Your birthday isn’t the only day that’s special, it’s every day that you exist, because your presence itself is a gift. <br><br>
                
                With Love,<br>
                Your only Cas
</p><br><br>
